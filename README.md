# IoT Assignments

This repository has been created as part of my master's degree @Sapienza University, to submit assignments for the 2020 IoT class, and to make pubicly available my work. These kind of assignments aim to build an IoT system from scratch, so my advise if anyone want to use it, is to start from the first assignment to the last, because they are very strictly related. Below there is the complete list of the assignement I have done so far, for each of them, a link to the curresponding folder is provided, with a brief description of the task that it accomplishes. For further details about the single assignments there is a specific markdown document in each folder. In this document you will find a link to an hands on guide to replicate the system in question, and to a short youtube video that illustrates its functioning.


[iot-first-assignment](https://github.com/nictuss/iot-assignments/tree/master/simulated_devices): visualize telemetry data from simulated IoT devices using the MQTT protocol on Azure

[iot-second-assignment](https://github.com/nictuss/iot-assignments/tree/master/MQTTSN-MQTT): retrieve telemetry data from sensors and send it to a web app through MQTT with RIOT os

[iot-third-assignment](https://github.com/nictuss/iot-assignments/tree/master/LoRa): send telemetry data through LoRa using St-Lrwan1 devices and the things network

[web application](https://github.com/nictuss/iot-assignments/tree/master/web_app): a simple web app that allows to visualize telemetry data, and stores it in a noSQL database

If you want to see all the three assignments' systems up and running I suggest you to watch my playlist on Youtube: [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFMhfn1hFBtwEk9WfoHxlpllm-htPJ5d)
