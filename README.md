# IoT Assignments

This repo has been created to submit assignments for the 2020 IoT class @Sapienza University, and to make pubicly available
my work. These kind of assignments aim to build an IoT system from scratch, so my advise if anyone want to repliucate it, is
to start from the first assignment to the last, because they are very strictly related. In every assignment folder you will find a link to an hands on guide, and to a short youtube video that illustrates the functioning of the system built so far.
