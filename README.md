# IoT Assignments

This repository has been created as part of my master's degree @Sapienza University, to submit assignments for the 2020 IoT class, and to
make pubicly available my work. These kind of assignments aim to build an IoT system from scratch, so my advise if anyone want to
repliucate it, is to start from the first assignment to the last, because they are very strictly related. In every assignment folder you
will find a link to an hands on guide, and to a short youtube video that illustrates the functioning of the system built so far.

**iot-first-assignment**: visualize telemetry data from simulated IoT devices using the MQTT protocol on Azure (simulated_devices)

**iot-second-assignment**: retrieve telemetry data from sensors and send it to a web app through MQTT with RIOT os (RIOT_os)
